Description:
We want to refactor the backend adopt our new counterstrikey theme.

We need to drop the animal sales and adopt the arms dealing strategy for counter strike in game weapons
The weapons should be the same as the ones in the game.
They should be priced accoringly, ie more expensive than stupid animals.

Database may need to be updated to support the new weapons.


Apis should be updated to support the new weapons naming convention.

Success Criteria:

- Backend should be refactored to support the new weapons.
- Api updated to support the new weapons naming convention.
